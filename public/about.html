<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in C++ and Java, now expanding my skills into full-stack web development. I'm currently taking “The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp” to master modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.</p>

<p>With a background in systems-level and object-oriented programming, I enjoy breaking down complex problems and building efficient, scalable solutions. I'm excited about bringing ideas to life on the web and bridging the gap between front-end design and back-end logic.
</p>
<p>When I’m not coding, you might find me learning something new, debugging just one more bug, or experimenting with side projects to sharpen my skills.</p>
